# fool

Generate server side API code for Golang from open api specifications

It's called fool, cause I am a fool for making this project.

## Why

I've been wanting to do some more code generation at work, but the tools
didn't seem to my like and I've been wanting to try and write a code generation
tool for a while now, for any purpose really. So I thought, why not combine
the two thing.

Will I ever finish / properly start the project, who knows.

## Usage

You can't, there's no code!
